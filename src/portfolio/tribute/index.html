          <p>
            The Enigma machine was a major part in Nazi Germany's secret communications during World War II and used a complex encryption to send messages. It was a challenge to decrypt because the encryption key changed frequently.

          <h2 class="text-center">Bombe</h2>
          <p>
            Multiple allied countries attempted to break code, but most were unsuccessful. Turing worked at Britain's Bletchley Park in secret with a team of researchers and they constructed a machine called the Bombe. The Allies the were able to acquire an intact Enigma unit, which Turing and his team used to assist in deciphering the machine using Bombe.

          <p>
            Once deciphered, the Allies were able to intercept many encrypted German orders in secret. This helped the Allies gain a major advantage and saved many lives.
            
While the Allies kept his work secret for many years, it was later made public and has had a great impact on modern technology.
